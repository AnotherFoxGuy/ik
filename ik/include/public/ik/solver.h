 * @brief Allocates a new solver object according to the specified algorithm.
 *
 * Once the solver is created, you can configure the solver to enable/disable
 * various features depending on your needs.
 *
 * The following attributes can be changed at any point.
 *  + solver->max_iterations
 *       Specifies the maximum number of iterations. The more iterations, the
 *       more exact the result will be. The default value for the FABRIK solver
 *       is 20, but you can get away with values as low as 5.
 *  + solver->tolerance
 *       This value can be changed at any point. Specifies the acceptable
 *       distance each effector needs to be to its target position. The solver
 *       will stop iterating if the effectors are within this distance. The
 *       default value is 1e-3. Recommended values are 100th of your world
 *       unit.
 *  + solver->flags
 *       Changes the behaviour of the solver. See the enum solver_flags_e for
 *       more information.
 *
 * The following attributes can be accessed (read from) but should not be
 * modified.
 *  + solver->tree
 *       The tree to be solved. You may modify the nodes in the tree.
 *       @note If you add/remove nodes or if you add/remove effectors, you
 *       must call ik_solver_rebuild_data() so the internal solver structures
 *       are updated. Failing to do so may cause segfaults. If you're just
 *       updating positions/rotations or any of the other public data then
 *       there is no need to rebuild data.
 *  + solver->effector_nodes_list
 *       A vector containing pointers to nodes in the tree which have an
 *       effector attached to them. You may not modify this list, but you may
 *       iterate it.
 * @param[in] algorithm The algorithm to use. Currently, only FABRIK is
 * supported.
